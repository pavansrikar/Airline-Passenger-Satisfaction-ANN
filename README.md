# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-ANN

‚úàÔ∏è Excited to share my latest project: Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), completed as part of my Data Science course at Innomatics Research Labs!

This deep learning project focused on predicting passenger satisfaction, using advanced neural network techniques to analyze complex datasets. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the project and my learning experience:

üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview:
Objective: Build and train a deep learning model using ANN to predict airline passenger satisfaction based on factors like service quality, comfort, and flight experience.

## Key Components:
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training, handling missing values and normalizing numerical features.
One-hot encoded categorical variables (e.g., flight class, customer type) to make the data suitable for deep learning.

Model Design & Training:
Developed a multi-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
Experimented with various architectures, adjusting layers, activation functions, and optimizers to maximize model performance.
Implemented techniques like early stopping and dropout to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
Evaluated the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting passenger satisfaction, with the ANN model outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Insights:
Key drivers of satisfaction included inflight service, seat comfort, and cleanliness.
Provided actionable insights for airlines to focus on improving customer satisfaction and experience.

üí° Skills Gained:

Deep Learning: Gained practical experience in building and training ANN models.

Data Preprocessing: Enhanced skills in preparing complex datasets for deep learning applications.

Model Optimization: Developed an understanding of hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques for neural networks.

Python Libraries: Used TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
